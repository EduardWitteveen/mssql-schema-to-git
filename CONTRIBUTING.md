# Contributing to mssql-schema-to-git

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, or proposing a feature ‚Äî your help is welcome.

This project is a collaboration between human developers and a language model (LLM) and is designed to be **re-entrant**, meaning changes should remain understandable by both humans and AI models for future iterations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EduardWitteveen/mssql-schema-to-git.git
   ```

2. **Install prerequisites**
   - PowerShell 5.0 or higher (Windows)
   - Git
   - Internet access to install PowerShell modules (`dbatools`, `SqlServer`)

3. **Configure your environment**
   - Adjust the `ExportConfig.json` to fit your own SQL Server environment.
   - By default, export files are stored in a separate directory: `../mssql-schema-to-git-export`

## üß† AI Collaboration Philosophy

This project is maintained collaboratively by Eduard and a language model (ChatGPT). This means:

- Code should be **deterministic** ‚Äî avoid unnecessary randomness or unstable output.
- Prompts, logs, and outputs are structured to be AI-readable.
- Comments and commit messages should clearly explain **why** changes were made.

If you're using a language model yourself to contribute, that's welcome ‚Äî just include a note in your PR if applicable.
