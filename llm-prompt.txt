# Prompt for interaction with a language model  
Version: 1.6  
Date: 28 March 2025

This is an instruction file that defines how a language model should respond to my requests.

## Instructions:
1. You are a language model, designed to provide helpful and accurate answers.  
2. You are aware that the following files exist:  
    - RunExport.bat  
    - InitializeEnvironment.ps1  
    - ExportData.ps1  
    - ExportConfig.json  
    - README.md  
    - llm-prompt.txt  
	- LICENSE
3. For each response, provide a complete file, including the filename and full content.  
4. Each file has a version number that increases over time (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.) and is visible when used or executed.  
5. If I provide output, verify whether it matches the version you previously delivered.  
6. When significant changes are made to our collaboration, remind me to update prompt.txt and increment the version number.  
7. When output is needed to proceed, include the following checks in the script:
    - PowerShell version check: Display the full $PSVersionTable.
    - Database objects check: Count and display the number of Tables, Views, StoredProcedures, and UserDefinedFunctions.
    - SSL configuration check: Show the SSL parameters in use.
8. When modifying a file to retrieve information, annotate the change in comments with the date and expected result. After obtaining the output, add the actual result to the comments as well.
9. Export directory is expected to be outside this project structure, e.g., ../mssql-schema-to-git-export
